    "Odds are calculated by taking the number of events where something happened and dividing by the number events where that same something didn’t happen. For example, if the odds of winning a game are 5 to 2, we calculate the ratio as 5/2=2.5. On the other hand, probability is calculated by taking the number of events where something happened and dividing by the total number events (including events when that same something did and didn’t happen). For example, the probability of winning a game with the same odds is 5/(5+2)=0.714."
